This project presents the design and implementation of a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog.
Verilog is a hardware description language(HDL) used for modeling electronic systems. 
The design involves creating individualmodules for logical, arithmetic, and multiplication operations and integrating them into a single ALU module.
Simulation and synthesis demonstrate the functionality and correctness of the ALU design.
